## Available Test Scenes:

* **BushScene**: Demonstrates the foliage shader to generate leaves on 3D meshes.
* **CelScene**: Demonstrates the cel shader that should be used.
* **FullScene**: Demonstrates a full complete forest scene, as one would make for a game.
* **FullSceneBase**: Demonstrates the same scene as *FullScene* but without Pixel3D custom render pipeline.
* **GrassScene**: Demonstrates a small scene with instanced grass.
* **GrassSceneLarge**: Demonstrates a larger scene with instanced grass that uses chunking and frustum culling.
* **PixelOutlineScene**: Demonstrates the pixel-perfect outline shader.
* **WaterScene**: Demonstrates a small scene with water.
* **WaterSceneLarger**: Demonstrates a larger scene with water.
